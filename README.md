# AuxQ

This is the source code for AuxQ, my February personal project.

AuxQ is a service that allows you to crowdsource the aux cord and let your friends make collaborative playlists. The way it works is that you have one master device that plays the music. You can distribute a shareable link to your friends who can add songs to the playlist through a nifty form. Your friends can then collaborate and add songs to the playlist while the master device plays and curates which songs get played.
